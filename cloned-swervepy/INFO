# This directory, except for this INFO file, is a clone of the swervepy repo
# available on GitHub from EWall25.  When creating a new swerve drive robot,
# the following initial steps are performed:

# (create the repo on GitHub)
# (clone the new repo locally)
# (change into the new repo directory)

# Add a copy of the cloned swervepy repo to the new robot's repo
git clone https://github.com/EWall25/swervepy

# Rename the swervepy repo, so that we can import swervepy
mv -i swervepy cloned-swervepy
ln -s cloned-swervepy/swervepy .

# Add swervepy content to new robot's .gitignore -- we're just cloning it,
# not editing it
printf "\n\n# Just clone swervepy repo, don't track it in Git\ncloned-swervepy/.editorconfig\ncloned-swervepy/.gitignore\ncloned-swervepy/LICENSE\ncloned-swervepy/README.md\ncloned-swervepy/example_robot/\ncloned-swervepy/pyproject.toml\ncloned-swervepy/swervepy/\n\n" >> .gitignore 

# Update the new robot repo with our initial changes
git add .gitignore
