# This is a simple example robot that uses the swervepy repo available on
# GitHub from EWall25.  When creating a new swerve drive robot, the following
# initial steps are required:

# (create the repo on GitHub)
# (use the new-project.sh script from the SimpleCommandRobot repo to create a
#  new project locally)
# (change into the new repo directory)

# Add the swervepy repo as a Git "submodule"
git submodule add https://github.com/EWall25/swervepy code/swervepy_module

# Create a link to that submodule, so that you can import the library
cd code
ln -s swervepy_submodule/swervepy swervepy

# You might want to start your robot code by using swervepy's example robot
# as a template:

cp swervepy_module/example_robot/[cpr]* .
git add [cpr]*
git commit

# And of course don't forget to do this...
cd ..
robotpy --main code sync
